## Introduction

This project analyzes the 2024 billing and payment performance across Nigeria’s electricity distribution companies (DISCOs). The goal is to understand consumer payment behavior, arrears accumulation, customer distribution, and tariff band trends. The analysis supports decision-making for improving billing efficiency, revenue collection, and service reliability in the Nigerian power sector.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard highlights three main KPIs and six analytical visuals.


- Total Billing: ₦4.6B



- Total Payments: ₦4.3B



- Total Arrears: ₦357.1M



### Additional analyses include:


- Monthly Payment Trends


- Payment Timeliness Distribution


- Top 5 DISCOs by Payment

  

- Top 5 DISCOs by Arrears

  

- Tariff Band Contributions



- Customer Distribution by DISCO



Skills and Concepts Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Removed inconsistencies, standardized columns, and formatted numeric values for currency-based analysis.
  

- Pivot Table Analysis: Built pivot tables to summarize billing, payment, and arrears across DISCOs and months.


- Dashboard Design & Visualization: Designed a dynamic Excel dashboard with interactive slicers for DISCO selection.


- Trend Analysis: Analyzed payment performance over time to identify peak months and arrears buildup.


- KPI Development: Created summary cards using Excel formulas and data visualizations for quick insight.


- Data Storytelling: Interpreted metrics to support decisions related to payment efficiency and customer engagement.

### Analysis

#### 1. Monthly Payment Trend

   

- Peak Payment Month: May, with ₦360.6M in payments.

- Trend shows steady performance mid-year, with mild drops during January, June and September.

  

#### 2. Payment Timeliness

   

- Out of 200K customers, over 163.9K paid on time.

- This indicates an on-time payment rate of over 80%, reflecting improved compliance.

  

#### 3. Payment by Top 5 DISCOs



- Eko and Jos lead with ₦434.4M and ₦433.3M respectively.

- This suggests stronger consumer response and better collection management in these zones.

  

#### 4. Arrears by Top 5 DISCOs



- Ikeja leads with ₦36.4M in arrears, followed closely by Eko and Jos.

- Indicates areas where billing recovery efforts can be intensified.

  

#### 5. Customer Distribution by DISCO



- Eko has the highest customer count at 20.2K, while Ibadan records the lowest at 19.8K.

- Distribution is relatively balanced across regions, with less than 5% variance between DISCOs.





#### 6. Payment by Tariff Band



- Tariff Band C contributes the most payments, totaling ₦1.4B.

- Lower bands (D and E) record minimal payments, indicating concentration in middle-tier consumers.







### Need Analysis

The analysis addresses critical needs in the Nigerian power sector:

- Revenue Optimization: Identifies high-performing DISCOs and those with weak payment compliance.
  

- Billing Efficiency: Highlights arrears sources and payment delays for targeted improvement.
  

- Policy Planning: Supports energy regulators and stakeholders with data-driven insight into payment behavior and tariff efficiency.
  

- Customer Management: Aids DISCOs in understanding customer segmentation and engagement performance.




## Conclusion

The dashboard reveals:

- Strong billing and payment performance in 2024, with a 93% payment-to-billing ratio.
  

- Concentrated payment strength in Eko and Jos DISCOs.
  

- Arrears remain moderate, suggesting steady collection improvements.
  

- Majority of payments arise from mid-level tariff bands (Band C).




## Recommendations

- Target High-Arrears Zones: Prioritize Ikeja, Eko, and Jos for arrears recovery initiatives.



- Promote On-Time Payments: Implement incentives for customers with consistent payment history.



- Review Tariff Structures: Strengthen middle-tier tariffs (Band C) to sustain payment performance.
  


- Expand Digital Billing Systems: Enhance payment automation to maintain the 80%+ on-time rate.
  


- Customer Awareness: Increase education on the importance of timely bill settlement to sustain power reliability.
